# Alternate Forecasting

This branch is an attempt at more direct forecasting using an equation driven approach, rather than entirely ML.
The initial commit uses (1 - cloud fraction) * theoretical GHI as a starting point, though this is obviously not a good solution.
Future changes should be noted in commit comments.
